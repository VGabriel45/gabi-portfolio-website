---

As Solidity developers, we're always on the lookout for proposals that could significantly impact our smart contract development workflow. EIP-7702 represents a revolutionary step forward, bridging the gap between Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) and smart contract wallets.

## The Core Concept

EIP-7702 introduces a new transaction type that allows EOAs to temporarily set account code for a single transaction. This seemingly simple change opens up a world of possibilities for enhancing EOA functionality without sacrificing the simplicity that makes EOAs attractive to users.

### New Transaction Type

The proposal introduces a new EIP-2718 transaction type, dubbed the "set code transaction." Here's what the RLP serialization looks like:

```solidity
rlp([
    chain_id,
    nonce,
    max_priority_fee_per_gas,
    max_fee_per_gas,
    gas_limit,
    destination,
    value,
    data,
    access_list,
    authorization_list,
    signature_y_parity,
    signature_r,
    signature_s
])
```

The `authorization_list` is the key new element here, containing tuples of:

```solidity
[chain_id, address, nonce, y_parity, r, s]
```

## Technical Deep Dive

### Delegation Designation

EIP-7702 introduces a "delegation designation" using the banned opcode `0xef` from EIP-3541. The designation takes the form:

```solidity
0xef0100 || address
```

This designation affects various instructions including:
- EXTCODESIZE
- EXTCODECOPY
- EXTCODEHASH
- CALL
- CALLCODE
- STATICCALL
- DELEGATECALL

### Gas Costs

The intrinsic cost builds on EIP-2930, with additional costs for the authorization list:

```solidity
21000 + 16 * non-zero calldata bytes + 4 * zero calldata bytes +
1900 * access list storage key count + 2400 * access list address count +
PER_AUTH_BASE_COST * authorization list length
```

Where `PER_AUTH_BASE_COST` is set to 2500.

## Implementation Benefits

### New Possibilities

1. **Batching Operations**
   - Perform multiple operations in one atomic transaction
   - Significantly improve gas efficiency for complex DApp interactions

2. **Transaction Sponsorship**
   - Enable account X to pay for account Y's transaction
   - Open new possibilities for meta-transactions
   - Enhance gas abstraction capabilities

3. **Privilege De-escalation**
   - Allow users to sign sub-keys with limited permissions
   - Enhance security in smart contract wallets

## Security Considerations

When implementing delegate contracts, several security aspects need attention:

1. **Replay Protection**
   - Implement and sign over a nonce in delegate contracts
   - Ensure transaction uniqueness

2. **Value Protection**
   - Sign over the `value` field
   - Prevent unexpected effects in the callee

3. **Gas Protection**
   - Sign over gas limits
   - Prevent potential griefing attacks

4. **Target/Calldata Protection**
   - Sign over specific parameters
   - Prevent calling arbitrary functions in arbitrary contracts

## Breaking Changes

The proposal introduces some notable changes to existing patterns:

1. Account balance changes can now occur without direct account initiation
2. EOA nonces may increase after transaction execution begins
3. Potential impacts on mempool designs and inclusion lists

## Future Implications

As we move towards "endgame account abstraction," EIP-7702 provides:

- A pragmatic stepping stone for advanced EOA functionality
- Backward compatibility with existing systems
- Enhanced experimentation capabilities
- Foundation for next-generation dApps

## Conclusion

EIP-7702 marks a significant advancement in Ethereum's account model evolution. It provides developers with powerful new tools while maintaining backward compatibility. As we continue to build towards a more sophisticated blockchain ecosystem, proposals like EIP-7702 demonstrate how thoughtful protocol improvements can enhance both developer experience and end-user functionality.

The future of Ethereum development looks promising with such innovations, enabling more complex interactions while maintaining the security and simplicity that users expect from blockchain applications.
